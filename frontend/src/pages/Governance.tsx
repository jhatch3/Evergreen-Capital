          <p>
            Our AI hedge fund uses a multi-agent consensus system where five specialized agents analyze market opportunities independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each agent votes YES or NO on proposed trades based on their domain expertise. A proposal requires majority approval (3/5) to be executed.
          </p>
          <p>
            All reasoning, data sources, and decision transcripts are transparently recorded on-chain and stored on IPFS for full auditability.
